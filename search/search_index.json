It's awesome. The only issue is that these message stay unread, and seeing a bunch of unread messages in my archive or labels annoys me, so every morning I search \"label:unread\" and mark all as read. It's a total first world problem, but annoying nonetheless. I've been looking for some sort of app or something to auto-mark-as-read any messages not in the inbox for months now. Then someone recently pointed me to Google Apps Script and 10 minutes later I had a script running which automatically marks all archived messages as read every minute. I was blown away at how easy this was. Here's how it's done. Head to script.google.com to start a script. Choose to create a script for Gmail in the little popup. Delete all the sample code it gives you. Replace it with this (written using the API reference): function markArchivedAsRead () { var threads = GmailApp . search ( \"label:unread -label:inbox\" ); GmailApp . markThreadsRead ( threads ); } Save the project with File > Save. Add a new version using File > Manage Versions and enter \"initial version\" then submit that. Do a test run using Run > markArchivedAsRead and be sure and authorize the app when it asks you to. Add a new trigger using Resource > Current Project's Triggers and choose to run the above function every minute (or hour or day or whatever if you want to be nice to Google's servers). Save the script again and exit. Don't worry, it will keep running. And you're done. It will continue to run every minute until you stop it. How awesome is that? Update: Some people are reporting an error which says \"This operation can only be applied to at most 100 threads. (line 3, file \"Code\")\". To fix this, you have to manually do a search for \"is:unread\" and mark all of them as read before running the script, so that it starts with a clean slate. The script can only process 100 threads per run, so if you give it more than 100 on the first run, that'll obviously bust it.","title":"Gmail Mark As Read Script"},{"location":"general/gmailMarkAsRead/#marking_gmail_read_with_apps_script","text":"Recent versions of Android give you the ability to Archive an email right from the notification bar: I use this like 30 times a day, for emails that I can tell from the subject that I don't need to read.

We try and stick with a simple combination of emojis and bold text for title. Most markdown is supported in the blockquote format, editors support formatting and syntax highlighting, has nice support for autocompletion (on emojis too in Atom at least) Finally, it degrades nicely and will still look decent in markdown parsers that support the basics, such as github.

Attach them to the emoji that is being used to setup the block. like so > :memo:{.small} ... . #id reference links \u00b6 Using the attributes plugin you can assign reference id's to link back to. You can , for example, refer and link to figures such as linking to the example table figure at the start of this doc. We do this with the attributes plugin by assigning a unique id to the figure above like this > :camera:{#example-table-figure} ... and then reference that link like this [ example figure ]( # example - table - figure ) . The hash symbol # is short hand for id= . Floats \u00b6 Floats can use emojis too. add :point_left: to float left and :point_right: to float right floated left callout > :mega: :point_left: floated left callout Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat. se cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur.

Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. Example Tip This is a tip admonition It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum. Where does it come from? \u00b6 Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of \"de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum\" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, \"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..\", comes from a line in section 1.10.32. Why do we use it? \u00b6 Sample Code let x = 1 x ++ for foo in some It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like). Where can I get some? \u00b6 foo There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc. Figure With a Table Header One Header Two :---------- :--------------------------- Item One Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, bboo baz Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.

For example, <section></section> should be wrapped as \"inline\". For example, ` < section ></ section > ` should be wrapped as \"inline\". Indented code \u00b6 Or indent several lines of code by at least four spaces, as in: // Some comments line 1 of code line 2 of code line 3 of code // Some comments line 1 of code line 2 of code line 3 of code Block code \"fences\" \u00b6 Use \"fences\" ``` to block in multiple lines of code. \u0002wzxhzdk:21\u0003 Sample text here... HTML: < pre > < p > Sample text here... </ p > </ pre > Syntax highlighting \u00b6 GFM, or \"GitHub Flavored Markdown\" also supports syntax highlighting. To activate it, simply add the file extension of the language you want to use directly after the first code \"fence\", ``` js , and syntax highlighting will automatically be applied in the rendered HTML. For example, to apply syntax highlighting to JavaScript code: \u0002wzxhzdk:24\u0003 Renders to: grunt . initConfig ({ assemble : { options : { assets : 'docs/assets' , data : 'src/data/*.{json,yml}' , helpers : 'src/custom-helpers.js' , partials : [ 'src/partials/**/*.{hbs,md}' ] }, pages : { options : { layout : 'default.hbs' }, files : { './' : [ 'src/templates/pages/index.hbs' ] } } } }; And this complicated HTML: <div class= \"highlight\" ><pre><span class= \"nx\" > grunt </span><span class= \"p\" > . </span><span class= \"nx\" > initConfig </span><span class= \"p\" > ({ </span> <span class= \"nx\" > assemble </span><span class= \"o\" > : </span> <span class= \"p\" > { </span> <span class= \"nx\" > options </span><span class= \"o\" > : </span> <span class= \"p\" > { </span> <span class= \"nx\" > assets </span><span class= \"o\" > : </span> <span class= \"s1\" > 'docs/assets' </span><span class= \"p\" > , </span> <span class= \"nx\" > data </span><span class= \"o\" > : </span> <span class= \"s1\" > 'src/data/*.{json,yml}' </span><span class= \"p\" > , </span> <span class= \"nx\" > helpers </span><span class= \"o\" > : </span> <span class= \"s1\" > 'src/custom-helpers.js' </span><span class= \"p\" > , </span> <span class= \"nx\" > partials </span><span class= \"o\" > : </span> <span class= \"p\" > [ </span><span class= \"s1\" > 'src/partials/**/*.{hbs,md}' </span><span class= \"p\" > ] </span> <span class= \"p\" > }, </span> <span class= \"nx\" > pages </span><span class= \"o\" > : </span> <span class= \"p\" > { </span> <span class= \"nx\" > options </span><span class= \"o\" > : </span> <span class= \"p\" > { </span> <span class= \"nx\" > layout </span><span class= \"o\" > : </span> <span class= \"s1\" > 'default.hbs' </span> <span class= \"p\" > }, </span> <span class= \"nx\" > files </span><span class= \"o\" > : </span> <span class= \"p\" > { </span> <span class= \"s1\" > './' </span><span class= \"o\" > : </span> <span class= \"p\" > [ </span><span class= \"s1\" > 'src/templates/pages/index.hbs' </span><span class= \"p\" > ] </span> <span class= \"p\" > } </span> <span class= \"p\" > } </span> <span class= \"p\" > } </span> <span class= \"p\" > }; </span> </pre></div> Tables \u00b6 Tables are created by adding pipes as dividers between each cell, and by adding a line of dashes (also separated by bars) beneath the header. Note that the pipes do not need to be vertically aligned. | Option | Description | | ------ | ----------- | | data | path to data files to supply the data that will be passed into templates. | | engine | engine to be used for processing templates.

Then check out MDwiki's quick start . Whenever you feel stuck, go to MDwiki's own site for further information. One Wiki Only? Fork It \u00b6 First off fork this repo and call it something like <MyProject>-wiki . Multiple Wikis? Clone It \u00b6 In case would you like to create more than one wiki for the same GitHub user or organization, then forking won't cut it. At the moment of this writing GitHub won't allow you to fork a single repository multiple times for the same account. There's a workaround to this, however on GitHub's web interface you won't see the sign that says \"forked from\" in your cloned repository. Below instructions how to clone this repository using the CLI: First off, create a new (empty) repository on GitHub, then; git clone https://github.com/exalted/mdwiki-seed.git cd mdwiki-seed git remote add foobar <HTTPS/SSH Clone URL of the New Repository> git push foobar gh-pages Create a New Wiki \u00b6 It all begins by creating an initial file structure for any language that you would like to support. For example, if you're interested having a wiki in English, then you will duplicate ll_CC folder and rename your copy to en . (For a complete list of languages [ ll ] and country codes [ CC ] see here .) ll_CC is a starter template folder which you shouldn't ever edit directly, since you may loose your changes when MDwiki gets updated later. If you want to have your wiki in more than one language, then you duplicate ll_CC as many times as necessary and rename each copy with the appropriate language and country code. (Country code is optional and it is only useful if you want to distinguish, for instance, American English from British English, such as: en_US and en_GB .) Getting Started \u00b6 You should have a language wiki folder by now, if not, go back and read above to create one. Suppose your first wiki is going to be in English, hence you must have a folder called en , as previously described. Open index.html file with your favorite plain text editor (the one that is at the same level where ll_CC and your language folder is located, NOT the one inside your language folder ) Find where it says \"Override ll_CC below with your default language and country code\" Change refresh meta tag from url=ll_CC/ to url=en/ (trailing / is very important) Structure \u00b6 All file references here are relative to their respective language folder. Name Type Description index.md File Starting point (a.k.a. \"home page\") for your wiki. Note this is not the index.html , but index.md ! navigation.md File Various settings of your wiki (e.g., name of your wiki, items in the navigation bar at the top, etc.) config.json File If you don't know what this is for, don\u2019t touch it. pages Folder Ideally, inside this folder, you create one *.md file for every page inside your wiki (e.g., foo.md , much-longer-names-are-also-okay.md , etc.) You can also create as many subfolders as you need, just remember to link them accordingly. uploads Folder An example folder structure where you could put other files. Although it is best to host your files somewhere else, like Dropbox, or a CDN, etc. Best Practices \u00b6 Relative URLs \u00b6 Instead of using absolute URLs when linking one wiki page to another, use relative URLs. For instance if en/pages/foo.md page had to link to en/pages/bar.md , it is enough to just add [ Click here ]( bar . md ) in your markdown. Don't Host Your Uploads in Git(Hub) \u00b6 Instead of hosting your uploads inside the uploads folder, consider using Dropbox, Google Drive, or a CDN. Add References to Uploads \u00b6 Whenever you can, avoid hosting your uploads using Git(Hub). If you must add references to files hosted inside the uploads folder here's how to do it, for instance: ! [ Image Title ]( uploads / images / foo . png ) . Add that in your markdown and you're good to go. How to Preview \u00b6 In order to preview your changes locally, prior to publishing online, you may need to take some actions. Below some starting points for each operating system, also check out MDwiki's frequently asked questions section for some ideas. Mac OS \u00b6 The easiest way to serve up static sites on a Mac is to use Anvil . Go ahead and download it from their website, install and add a site using the status bar icon: simply select the folder where your wiki is located on your Mac. If you don't want to download any apps, you can use the Terminal on your Mac and Python. To do this, go to your site folder in the Terminal app and type python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000 . This will start running a local server which you can navigate to by typing the URL localhost : 8000 in any web browser. Windows \u00b6 You can use Fenix to host a static site on windows. Fenix also comes with lots of advanced functionality that you might not use. Fenix can also run on a Mac. Linux \u00b6 You can use Prax . Prax is a pure ruby alternative to Pow!! that runs on GNU/Linux. For Developers \u00b6 You don't need to read below here or do anything at all if you're only interested creating your own wiki. This section is for developers or maintainers of this repository. Update MDwiki \u00b6 Current version: 0.6.2 .

Option 2 \u00b6 If you don't want to back up your entire system, but only specific files, I suggest you connect to your Raspberry Pi via SFTP and copy the files to your local computer (You can use the WinScp client). If you have SSH enabled, SFTP usually requires no special configuration on the Raspberry Pi side. Another option is to copy the files to a remote system using rsync . You can also install special drivers so your Windows can read ext filesystems (and will thus be able to read the whole SD card), such as ext2fsd but it is probably not worth the effort. Since the image will be of the same size as your SD card, you may want to compress it. This can be achieved simply by using your favorite compression tool, such as gzip, 7zip, WinZip, WinRar ...","title":"General"},{"location":"rasperryPi/piGeneral/#raspberry_pi_tips_tricks","text":"","title":"Raspberry Pi Tips &amp; Tricks"},{"location":"rasperryPi/piGeneral/#defalut_user_and_password_after_installation","text":"User: pi Password: raspberry","title":"Defalut User and Password After Installation"},{"location":"rasperryPi/piGeneral/#basic_raspbin_configuration","text":"sudo raspi-config","title":"Basic Raspbin Configuration"},{"location":"rasperryPi/piGeneral/#update_raspbian_os","text":"sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade -y","title":"Update Raspbian OS"},{"location":"rasperryPi/piGeneral/#install_fish_shell_on_raspbian","text":"sudo apt-get install software-properties-common sudo apt-add-repository ppa:fish-shell/release-2 sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install fish sudo usermod -s /usr/bin/fish pi","title":"Install Fish Shell on Raspbian"},{"location":"rasperryPi/piGeneral/#install_oh-my-zsh_on_raspbian","text":"sudo apt-get install -y zsh && sudo apt-get install -y git sudo wget https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/raw/master/tools/install.sh -O - | zsh && chsh -s ` which zsh ` sudo usermod -s /usr/bin/zsh pi Optioanl: Setting fishy skin: sudo sed -i 's/robbyrussell/fishy/g' ~/.zshrc Its Preffered to reboot after installation: sudo reboot","title":"Install Oh-My-Zsh on Raspbian"},{"location":"rasperryPi/piGeneral/#fixing_locale_failed_for_zsh","text":"This warning pops up in terminal: perl: warning: Setting locale failed. perl: warning: Please check that your locale settings: LANGUAGE = ( unset ) , LC_ALL = ( unset ) , LC_CTYPE = \"UTF-8\" , LANG = \"en_IL\" are supported and installed on your system. perl: warning: Falling back to a fallback locale ( \"en_IL\" ) . run this: echo \"export LC_ALL=C\" >> ~/.zshrc && source ~/.zshrc","title":"Fixing Locale failed for ZSH"},{"location":"rasperryPi/piGeneral/#show_respberry_temperature","text":"/opt/vc/bin/vcgencmd measure_temp","title":"Show Respberry Temperature"},{"location":"rasperryPi/piGeneral/#samba_for_raspberrypi","text":"sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install -y samba samba-common-bin smbclient cifs-utils sudo smbpasswd -a pi ( my-pi-samba-remote-password ) sudo nano /etc/samba/smb.conf change: workgroup = YOUR WINDOWS WORKGROUP NAME add at end: [ share ] path = /home/pi/Desktop/share available = yes valid users = pi read only = no browsable = yes public = yes writable = yes the shared path must exist: ( if you work via desktop ( HDMI or VNC ) it is very convenient just to read or drop from/to this shared dir ) mkdir /home/pi/Desktop/share sudo reboot Start samba Server sudo /usr/sbin/service smbd start","title":"Samba for RaspberryPi"},{"location":"rasperryPi/piGeneral/#clone_raspberry_pi_sd_card","text":"","title":"Clone Raspberry Pi SD Card"},{"location":"rasperryPi/piGeneral/#linux","text":"On Linux, you can use the standard dd tool: dd if = /dev/sdx of = /path/to/image bs = 1M","title":"Linux"},{"location":"rasperryPi/piGeneral/#mac","text":"On Mac, you can also use the standard dd tool with a slightly different syntax: dd if = /dev/rdiskx of = /path/to/image.img bs = 1m Where /dev/rdiskx is your SD card.
