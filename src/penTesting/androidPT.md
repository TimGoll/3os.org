# Android Penetration Testing

## ADB Over Network/Wifi

Connect your mobile device via USB and make sure usb debugging is on (you can do that via the developer options in your device). Also connect to your Wifi.

Open up the Terminal , provided you have the adb set in your PATH, type the following, this would list your device as connected over the USB

```bash
adb devices
```

To enable the wifi-debug-mode

```bash
adb tcpip 5555
```

__IMPORTANT : Remove USB Cable__
Connect your device by typing in the below in the terminal

```bash
adb connect DEVICE-IP-ADDRESS:5555

```
