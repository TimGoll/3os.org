# Welcome to 3os.org

## Who We Are

My name is Stas Kosatuhin.

I’ve created __3os.org Project__ with the knowledge I gathered over the years in my job and everyday life.  
The main purpose of this website is to provide simple knowledge base for IT, Security, Penetration Testing, useful guides links and tools.  
This website is based on [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/ "MkDocs Official Site"){target=_blank} with [Material theme](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/ "Material for MkDocs¶"){target=_blank}, It's being generated from markdowns from main branch of 3os.org [repository](https://github.com/fire1ce/3os.org/ "Github fire1ce/3os.org/ repository"){target=_blank} and hosted on [Github-Pages](https://pages.github.com/ "Github-Pages"){target=_blank}.  
I would like you and others to contribute your knowledge to 3os Project to preserved and improve any guide or information provided here for you and others.
