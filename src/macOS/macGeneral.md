# MacOS Tips & Guides

## Hide All The Icons On Your Desktop

Disable Icons:

```bash
defaults write com.apple.finder CreateDesktop false
killall Finder
```

Enable Icons:

```bash
defaults write com.apple.finder CreateDesktop true
killall Finder
```

## Change the Launchpad Grid Layout

Change the _springboard-columns_ and _springboard-rows_ values according to your preference

```bash
write com.apple.dock springboard-columns -int 9
write com.apple.dock springboard-rows -int 7
write com.apple.dock ResetLaunchPad -bool TRUE
killall Dock
```

## Disable StrictHostKeyChecking in SSH

To disable strict host checking on OS X for the current user,
create or edit ~/.ssh/ssh_config and add the following lines:

```bash
   StrictHostKeyChecking no
```

## Set the `Same View Options` for all Finder windows

First, we want to set the default view options for all new Finder windows. To do so, open Finder and click on the view setting that you want to use. The settings are four icons and the top of your Finder window.
If you don't see the Finder toolbar type:

```bash
cmd + option + t
```

After selecting the option you want, type:

```bash
cmd + j
```

to open the view options window.

Make sure you check the top two checkboxes that say Always open in list view and Browse in list view. Keep in mind it will reflect whichever view you've selected.

Now click the button at the bottom that says "Use as Defaults".

### Delete all .DS_Store files on your computer

Chances are you've opened some Finder windows in the past. Individual folder options will override this default setting that we just set.

In order reset your folder settings across the entire machine we have to delete all .DS_Store files. This will ensure that all folders start fresh. Open up the Terminal application (Applications/Utilities/Terminal), and type:

```bash
sudo find / -name .DS_Store -delete; killall Finder
```

`Note: In the future, whenever you switch views, it will automatically save in the new .DS_Store file. This will override the default settings.`

## List listening Ports and Programs and Users

```bash
sudo lsof -i -P | grep -i "listen"
```

## Installing rbenv (ruby send box) - Ruby alternative to the one that macOS uses

Install rbenv with brew

```bash

```

Add eval `"$(rbenv init -)"` to the end of `~/.zshrc` or `~/.bash_profile`

Install a ruby version

```bash
rbenv install 2.3.1
```

Select a ruby version by rbenv

```bash
rbenv global 2.3.1
```

Open a new terminal window

Verify that the right gem folder is being used with `gem env home`(should report something in your user folder not system wide)

## Reset Launchpad Icons Sort

```bash
defaults write com.apple.dock ResetLaunchPad -bool true; killall Dock
```

## Import RSA Keys

Copy your id_rsa, id_rsa.pub to _~/.ssh/_ folder

Step 1 - Store the key in the keychain
Just do this once:

```bash
ssh-add -K ~/.ssh/[your-private-key]
```

Enter your key passphrase, and you won't be asked for it again.

(If you're on a pre-Sierra version of OSX, you're done, Step 2 is not required.)

Step 2 - Configure SSH to always use the keychain
It seems that OSX Sierra removed the convenient behavior of persisting your keys between logins, and the update to ssh no longer uses the keychain by default. Because of this, you will get prompted to enter the passphrase for a key after you upgrade, and again after each restart.

The solution is fairly simple, and is outlined in this github thread comment. Here's how you set it up:

Ensure you've completed Step 1 above to store the key in the keychain.

If you haven't already, create an ~/.ssh/config file. In other words, in the .ssh directory in your home dir, make a file called config.

In that .ssh/config file, add the following lines:

```bash
Host *
  UseKeychain yes
  AddKeysToAgent yes
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

Change ~/.ssh/id_rsa to the actual filename of your private key. If you have other private keys in your ~.ssh directory, also add an IdentityFile line for each of them. For example, I have one additional line that reads IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 for a 2nd private key.

The UseKeychain yes is the key part, which tells SSH to look in your OSX keychain for the key passphrase.

That's it! Next time you load any ssh connection, it will try the private keys you've specified, and it will look for their passphrase in the OSX keychain. No passphrase typing required.
