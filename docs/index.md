    Welcome To Our New Site!  
    We Have transferred all the data from the old site, but we have a lot of work ahead to make this site much more useful for everyday use.  
    The biggest improvement (besides the design) is the "Pencil Edit" icon on each page. This will lead you to the original GitHub `.md` file from which the site is being generated. 
    You can now more easily submit changes to the information provided here.


### Who We Are

My name is Stas Kosatuhin.

Iâ€™ve created [3os](https://3os.org) with the knowledge I gathered over the years in my job and everyday life.
