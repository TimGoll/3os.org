## Updates

!!! info "NEW SITE IS HERE"
    Welcome To Our New Site!  
    We Have transferred all the data from the old site, but we have a lot of work ahead to make this site much more useful for everyday use.  
    The biggest improvement (besides the design) is the "Pencil Edit" icon on each page. This will lead you to the original GitHub `.md` file from which the site is being generated.
    You can now more easily submit changes to the information provided here.

!!! Warning "Some Updates"
    I'm working on a new features as you can see. One of them is Auto Generation of a changelog so you can followup with all the changes.
    As this feature is based on a github "tags/releases" I'm testing it on the production site.
    As you can see the changelog isn't consistent yet because of this. After I'll resolve all the bugs ill make an automation script to do all the version control, generation of the logs and the deployment.
