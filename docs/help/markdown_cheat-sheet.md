# TL;DR Cheat Sheet

For a 60 second quick start on Markdown
[commonmark has a great tutorial](http://commonmark.org/help/){.new-tab}

### Emphasis

<div markdown="1" class="two-column">

``` md
this is _italic_ and so is *this*
this is __bold__ and so is **this**
^^underline^^,  ~~strike through~~
==highlight==  and `inline code`
==*you* **can** ^^combine^^ `too`==

```

</div>

### Soft & Hard Line Breaks

<div markdown="1" class="two-column">

``` md
Put 2 spaces at the end of a line
to force a line break.
If you simply
hit enter and
don't use 2 spaces
it merges the lines
like this.
You can also force a break <br> anywhere
using the `<br>` tag like we just did
```

### Lists

<div markdown="1" class="two-column">

``` md
* need a blank line above to start new list
+ valid bullet symbols
+ `*`, `-` or '+'
    - 4 spaces or 1 tab
    - to indent

1. use *numbers* for ordered
    * can nest
2. **numbers** can be in order
    3. can also nest
1. but it will fix them if not

-   list item with two paragraphs.

    anything like this paragraph
    should be indented by 4 spaces
    or a tab

-   you can add blocks too

    > :memo:
    >
    > * list under lists
    > * under lists

```

### Tasks

<div markdown="1" class="two-column">

``` md
- [ ] Task Lists `- [ ]`
    - [x] x instead of space
    - [x] will mark it complete
- [ ] work just like lists
    * can can contain indents
    * or anything else a list can

1. Or can be nested under others lists
    - [ ] like this
    - [ ] and this

2. This can help
    - [ ] like this
    - [ ] and this
```

### Links

<div markdown="1" class="two-column">

``` md
[simple link](https://www.google.com )
[with optional title](https://www.google.com "Google's Homepage")
point to a [relative file or md](./embedding/lucid.md) or
mail link with emoji [üìß](mailto:joshdev@9ci.com) or
click this cloud icon to see the list of icon options
[_cloud_{.icon}](https://material.io/icons/)

or [use an image ![](../images/dingus/image-small.png)](../images/dingus/image.png)

[Reference-Style Links][some reference id]
put link at bottom of paragraph or page.
you can use numbers or text for
[reference-style link definitions][1]
or leave it empty and
just use the [link text itself]

to [open in new tab](sandbox.md){.new-tab}
use `{target=_blank} or {.new-tab}` attributes
use it on [ref links][new tab]{.new-tab} too

Indenting _reference links_
2 spaces is not required
but a recommended convention

  [some reference id]: https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax#link
  [1]: http://reason.com/blog
  [link text itself]: ./images/material.png
  [new tab]: sandbox.md

<div markdown="1" class="two-column">

``` md
inline ![](..images/dingus/image-small.png)

can use [sizing attributes](blocks/#sizing-alignment)

Put `zoomify` in the alt text bracket to enable

You can use any

### Tables

<div markdown="1" class="two-column">

```markdown
Colons can be used to align columns.
3 dashes min to separate headers.
Outer pipes (|) are optional,
and you don't need to make the
raw Markdown line up prettily.
You can also use inline Markdown.

| Tables   | Are           | Cool      |
|----------|---------------|-----------|
| col 3 is | right-aligned | $1600     |
| col 2 is | centered      | $12       |
|          | **Total**     | **$1612** |

==Table== | **Format** | üëÄ _scramble_
--- | --- | ---
*Still* | `renders` | **nicely**
[with links](../images/dingus/image-small.png) | images ![zoomify](../images/dingus/image-small.png){.tiny} | emojis üçî
icons _cloud_{.icon} | footnotes[^1] | use `<br>` <br> for multi-line <br> line breaks

### Row Divs

through out this doc we have been using a `<div markdown="1" class="two-column">`.

    <div markdown="1" class="two-column">{++markdown="1" tells it to process what inside++}
        {== <-needs to be a blank line for github to parse==}

    ```markdown
    |foo | bar |
    |----|-----|
    |baz | buzz|
    ```

    </div>
    <div markdown="1" class="two-column">

    |foo | bar |
    |----|-----|
    |baz | buzz|

    </div>  {== closes the div ==}

    --- {== this clears the "float" REQUIRED when done==}

<div markdown="1" class="two-column">

```markdown
| foo | bar  |
|-----|------|
| baz | buzz |
```

</div>
<div markdown="1" class="two-column">

    <div markdown="1" class="row">

    > :bug: **here is another example**
    this uses the row class and will make
    any blocks, figures, etc equal spaced

    ---

    > :thumbsup: they will be equal sizes
    with whatever width is left from image
    and as you can see the heights get adjusted to be equal as well
